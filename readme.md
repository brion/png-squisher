# PNG Squisher

Test GNOME app to load images and resave them as PNGs.

Made using Builder's templates. Loads an image into a GtkImage widget and then saves it to a PNG file using gdk-pixbuf, showing the time spent compressing in ms.

Using it to do basic benchmarking of default PNG compression using gdk-pixbuf + libpng, compared to say [mtpng](https://github.com/brion/mtpng).

If the app code is useful to you feel free to use it.
